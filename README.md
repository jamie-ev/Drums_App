# Pomodoro App
Built using React.js

## Description

I built this fully responsive and accessible drum simulator app to help me deepen my understanding of JavaScript, React.js, and cross-browser audio use. You can either use a keyboard or mouse to trigger the audio clips. A variety of functions are built into the React code to determine the logic of the app, govern which clips are played/reset, and modify the display to show your most recent clip selection. The background color of each button briefly shifts to indicate when it has been clicked/pressed.

## Getting Started

You can find my original files in /src/app, and the root files are copied over from /src/build. I commented fairly extensively throughout the files, but please let me know if you have any questions. To view this project live on GitHub Pages, please visit [this link](https://jamie-ev.github.io/Drums_App/). Thanks for dropping by!

### Depencies

* React
* ReactDOM
* Babel
* Webpack

(The last two are used to convert the JSX and ES6 from the React code.)
